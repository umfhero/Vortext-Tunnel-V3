                           VORTEX TUNNEL PROJECT DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Vortex Tunnel is a real-time collaborative desktop application designed for secure, 
direct peer-to-peer connections between computers. The application eliminates the 
need for traditional servers or complex port forwarding by leveraging Tailscale's 
mesh networking technology for secure, encrypted communication.

The project aims to combine the best features of modern communication platforms 
(like Discord Nitro's high-quality screen sharing and rich communications) with 
remote desktop capabilities (similar to Parsec) while adding unique collaborative 
features like persistent file vaults and real-time drawing.
