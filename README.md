<br><br>

**Vortex Tunnel** is a real-time collaborative desktop app for secure, direct connections between two PCs using **Tailscale**. No servers or port forwarding needed! Chat, share huge files, draw together, and access persistent "vaults" for files across all your devices. Think **Discord Nitro** (1080p screen sharing, rich comms) meets **Parsec** (PC control), with per-account vaults for file sync.
